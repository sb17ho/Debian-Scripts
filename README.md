# Debian-Scripts
The intent of these scripts was to develop for personal quick use. A user might/can find better solutions better solutions as per their needs

The scripts just combine a couple of commands to perform a particular task which otherwise would require you to input manually. 

New scripts are added when a new issue or requirement arise
